/// \class Image
/// \brief Class Line can be used for inserting image into another image.
///
/// Class Rectangle can be used for inserting image
/// into another image. New instance can be created by using
/// constructor or by using static method create,
/// which returns pointer to this instance. This class
/// inherits atributes from class Drawable, such as transparency.
/// Two points are needed to be able to insert image
/// into another image. Those points can set in create method
/// or by using set methods. Image, that will be inserted
/// can also be rotated, by selecting appropriate angle
/// in enum Rotation. If type Automatic is selected, image
/// rotation will be calculated based on coordinates of
/// the second inserted point. Final image is then scaled
/// and placed inbetween two input points. The image can be
/// with or without alpha channel. If the input image has
/// alpha channel, olny the non-transparent pixels will be
/// drawn.If instance is created by using constructor, method
/// draw needs to be called, in order to render the object.
///
/// After the object is created, it can be rendered into image
/// by calling method addDrawble from the class Renderer.
