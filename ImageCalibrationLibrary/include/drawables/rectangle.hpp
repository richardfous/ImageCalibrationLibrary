/// \class Rectangle
/// \brief Class Rectangle can be used for drawing squares and rectangles.
///
/// Class Rectangle can be used for drawing squares and
/// rectangles. New instance can be created by using
/// constructor or by using static method create,
/// which returns pointer to this instance. This class
/// inherits atributes from class Drawable, such as color
/// thickness and transparency. Two points are needed to draw
/// square or rectangle. Those points can set in create method
/// or by using set methods. If type rectangle is selected,
/// the rectangle is drawn inbetween those two points. If type
/// Square is selected a x coordinate of the second point is
/// used to calculate size of the square side. If instance is
/// created by using constructor, method draw needs to be
/// called, in order to render the object.
///
/// After the object is created, it can be rendered into image
/// by calling method addDrawble from the class Renderer.
